## Distractions

When was the last time you spent 20 minutes completely focused on any particular task? It doesn’t necessarily has to be related to your work, it can be anything like reading a book, listening to some songs, watching a movie or solving a problem. When did something had your undivided attention for more than 20 minutes? Chances are you don’t even remember that, and now you’ll make this phone the culprit for that, however, that’s not entirely the case. You can have your phone and control on your attention simultaneously, it’s tough, yes, but doable. And why won’t it be tough when some of the best minds of the century are working on grabbing your attention every single second. Know that “ting” ring your hear every time your iPhone receives a notification? It took years for sound engineers at Apple to come up with such a frequency that has the most influence on your mind, that urges you to check your phone. 

Now that we’ve established what these distractions are, let’s talk about silencing them.

## Muting the noises

There are a few techniques I’ve been using that have worked for me, I’ll be sharing those here.

### The HWRS approach

If you have an iPhone, following this would be easier as the feature this technique relies on is literally built in an iPhone. There is a feature called Focus on every iPhone which allows you to blacklist or whitelist people and apps you want to hear from, you can decide to block notifications from every app, you can decide block calls from everyone or just unknown numbers, or everyone except for the people in your whitelist. The idea is to divide your day and focus into 4 parts.

1. H: Health - this is the period of time between when you wake up and when you go to work. This time should be dedicated to your health, both physical and mental, you can practice meditation, hit a gym or practice yoga. During this time you can block all the people and apps except for your family and closest friends. In case of apps you can choose to greenlist the apps that help you with your health like Calm, HealthifyMe etc.
2. W: Work - this is the period of time when you’re at work, at this time you can block everything except for the people and apps that are work related, for example GMail, Slack, Your Manager etc.
3. R: Rest - This is the time when you can decide to be available to general public, you can check the messages/notifications you missed, iPhone has a nice notifications summary feature which gives you all the notifications you missed throughout the day. You can return the calls you missed, revert to the messages or snaps, check the likes, views on your posts/stories, etc.
4. S: Sleep - This is the time when you sleep and everything should be blocked except for your family or closest friends, in order for you to not miss important news.

### Green over Red

When blocking, always prefer greenlisting over redlisting, instead of telling your phone to block WhatsApp messages during work hours, tell it to only allow Slack; for example. This way you ensure that your focus would only be on the important stuff. Similarly instead of telling your phone to block work related calls during Rest hours, tell it to only allow calls from friends and family. By default you should block every unknown number and every app that sends useless notifications, I myself have blocked all the notifications, and I still do not miss a thing.

### The 20-5-40-10 principle

The idea is to focus on something for 20 minutes then taking a break for 5 minutes then again focusing on it for 40 minutes and then taking a break for 10 minutes. This simple approach works wonders if actually followed. We humans are no different from dogs who learn and work better when incentivised, use it for your benefit. The breaks that you take you can use them to look at the missed messages and notifications too.

### The weighted priority queue

Always have a queue of items that you’re supposed to do, always have a priority defined for those items along with a weight of fun the more fun a task is for you to do the more weight it would be said to have, the idea is to first pick the task with the most priority and most weight, and then the one with the most priority and lower weight. This will maintain the balance between the boring and interesting tasks.

## The defaults

It’s tough to ignore/avoid messages and notifications, I’ll share how I do it and it may make sense to you as well. The default setting for my phone is to block every unknown caller but if they call more than once in one minute, I’ll get that call. For those calls that I miss I just check on Truecaller and if they are not spam, I call back during my breaks. That if I feel like it, sometimes I assume that the matter wasn’t urgent enough otherwise they’d have called again. I have 0 upset friends/family members who feel that I’m not approachable enough, because I’m, I just prefer having some sort of discipline and they respect that, I do however call them as soon as I make time, you can too.

I know, I know, a lot here was actionable if you had an iPhone, but that’s not entirely true, Androids have some great set of apps, you can use to achieve the similar result, some hard work, dedication needed from your side.
